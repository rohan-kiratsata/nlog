## Introduction

In this blog post, we'll explore how to effectively render Markdown data in a Next.js application. We'll cover the basics, dive into some advanced techniques, and even touch on how Rust and React can play a role in this process.

## The Basics of Markdown Rendering

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to read and write. Here are some basic Markdown elements:

- **Bold text**: Use double asterisks like **this**.
- _Italic text_: Use single asterisks like _this_.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use double tildes like ~~this~~.

### Lists in Markdown

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- Unordered list item 1
- Unordered list item 2
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

## Code Blocks in Markdown

Inline code can be written like `this`. For larger code blocks, use triple backticks:

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  // Implementation goes here
  return arr.indexOf(target);
}
```

## Tables in Markdown

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |
